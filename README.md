This sofware is a Bayesian Inference Learning package based on populations
or distributionpopulations (see the module Game::Stats) which has 
hypothetical loss functions (Bayes, disjoint and joint probabilities) together
with a minimax value algorithm based on Action and Startegy classes.

It is to be used in games and was built for speed not general OOP.

Several examples are provided in the examples directory.
